# Veilglass - Technical Analysis & Documentation

## Executive Summary

Veilglass is a Unity-based location-aware cultural exploration application that transforms real-world geographic exploration into an immersive digital experience. The application leverages authentic OpenStreetMap data, UK parish boundaries, and GPS tracking to create a persistent fog-of-war system that reveals cultural, historical, and natural points of interest as users physically explore their environment.

## Project Classification

**Primary Category:** Location-Based Cultural Discovery Platform  
**Secondary Categories:** Educational Technology, Geographic Information System (GIS) Application, Augmented Reality Experience  
**Target Audience:** Cultural enthusiasts, history buffs, nature explorers, educational institutions  

## Core Philosophy

Unlike entertainment-focused location apps, Veilglass is fundamentally grounded in:
- **Cultural Heritage Preservation** - Highlighting local pubs, museums, artwork, and memorials
- **Historical Education** - Featuring castles, monuments, and heritage sites
- **Natural Environment Awareness** - Showcasing parks, nature reserves, forests, and hill peaks

### Technology Stack

**Core Framework:**
- Unity 2023.x with Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- C# (.NET Standard 2.1)
- Unity Input System for modern device interaction

**Geographic & Mapping:**
- OnlineMaps asset for tile-based mapping
- Google S2 Geometry Library for spherical calculations
- OpenStreetMap for authentic geographic data
- GeoJSON processing for administrative boundaries

**External Data Sources:**
- Overpass API for cultural POI discovery
- Geoapify API as backup data source
- UK Ordnance Survey parish boundary data

## Core Systems Analysis

### 1. Cultural Point of Interest (POI) Discovery System

**Primary Component:** `OSMPointsOfInterestFetcher.cs`

The POI system is the cultural heart of Veilglass, designed to surface authentic local heritage:

**Cultural Categories:**
- **Heritage Buildings:** Castles, historic structures, monuments
- **Cultural Institutions:** Museums, galleries, libraries
- **Artistic Heritage:** Public artwork, sculptures, memorials
- **Social Heritage:** Traditional pubs, community centers
- **Natural Heritage:** Hill peaks, ancient forests, nature reserves, heathland

**Technical Implementation:**
- Queries Overpass API with sophisticated filters for cultural relevance
- Implements intelligent caching to respect API rate limits
- Parish-based organization for community-relevant content
- Fallback systems for data reliability

### 2. Geographic Fog of War System

**Primary Components:** `FogOfWarOverlay.cs` + `DynamicS2FogClearer.cs`

This system creates a metaphorical "veil" over the landscape that lifts as users physically explore:

**Dual-Layer Fog Architecture:**
1. **Traditional Overlay System** - Texture-based fog on map tiles
2. **S2 Sphere System** - 3D geometric fog spheres using Google's S2 library

**Cultural Significance:**
- The fog metaphor represents unknown cultural heritage waiting to be discovered
- Physical presence is required to "unveil" local history and culture
- Cleared areas persist, creating a personal map of cultural exploration

### 3. Parish-Based Content Organization

**Primary Component:** `ParishBoundaryRenderer.cs`

Uses authentic UK administrative boundaries to organize cultural content:

**Benefits:**
- Connects users with their immediate local community
- Provides historically meaningful geographic divisions
- Enables parish-specific cultural statistics and achievements
- Supports potential community features and local engagement

### 4. Location Tracking & Validation

**Primary Component:** `PlayerTrackingManager.cs`

**Features:**
- GPS-based location tracking with accuracy validation
- "Mystical Eye" visual indicator for active tracking
- Smooth map transitions and zoom controls
- Battery-conscious update intervals

### 5. Data Persistence Architecture

**Components:** `GameProgressManager.cs` + `POICacheManager.cs`

**Dual Persistence Strategy:**
- **Permanent Progress:** Cultural discoveries, fog clearing, exploration history
- **Temporary Cache:** POI data with 30-day expiration to ensure freshness

## Data Flow & User Journey

```
1. User Location Detection → GPS Validation → Parish Identification
2. Parish Cultural Data → POI Discovery → Local Heritage Mapping
3. Physical Movement → Fog Clearing → Cultural Point Revelation
4. POI Interaction → Cultural Information Display → Discovery Logging
5. Progress Persistence → Community Statistics → Achievement Tracking
```

2. **Sophisticated Fog Rendering** - Dual-layer system with 3D geometric components
3. **Cultural Data Intelligence** - Smart filtering and caching of heritage information
4. **Persistent Geographic State** - Cross-session preservation of exploration progress
5. **Community-Aware Architecture** - Parish-based organization for local relevance

## Development Insights

The codebase demonstrates sophisticated understanding of:
- Geographic information systems (GIS)
- Real-time location processing
- Cultural data classification and presentation
- Performance optimization for mobile platforms
- Complex state management and persistence

## Conclusion

Veilglass represents a mature approach to location-based cultural discovery, combining advanced geographic processing with meaningful cultural content. The application successfully bridges digital technology with real-world heritage exploration, creating a platform that educates, preserves, and celebrates local cultural identity.

The technical architecture is robust, scalable, and purpose-built for cultural discovery rather than entertainment, positioning it as a valuable tool for heritage preservation, education, and community engagement.
