                <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 18 November 2025</p>

                <p><strong>Veilglass</strong> is operated by <strong>Hanshew BSF Limited</strong>, a company registered in the United Kingdom.</p>

                <div class="contact-info">
                    <strong>Contact Information:</strong><br>
                    Email: <a href="mailto:contact@project-enra.com">contact@project-enra.com</a><br>
                    Website: <a href="https://www.project-enra.com">www.project-enra.com</a>
                </div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when you use the Veilglass mobile application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Important:</strong> By using Veilglass, you consent to the data practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Location Data</h3>
    <p>Veilglass is a location-based exploration game that requires access to your device's location services. We collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise GPS Location:</strong> Your real-time latitude and longitude coordinates</li>
        <li><strong>Background Location Data:</strong> Location information even when the App is not actively in use or your screen is locked</li>
        <li><strong>Location History:</strong> A record of places you've visited while using the App</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy Data:</strong> GPS accuracy measurements to ensure quality of gameplay</li>
        <li><strong>Timestamps:</strong> When each location point was recorded</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="important">
        <strong>Why We Need Background Location:</strong> Background location tracking is essential to the core gameplay of Veilglass. It allows you to "clear fog" and explore while your phone is locked and in your pocket during walks or hikes. This prevents battery drain from keeping your screen on, reduces the risk of dropping your phone, and improves safety by not requiring constant phone interaction while moving.
    </div>

    <h3>1.2 Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account or sign in, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for authentication and account recovery</li>
        <li><strong>User ID:</strong> A unique identifier assigned by Firebase Authentication</li>
        <li><strong>Display Name:</strong> If you choose to provide one</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Provider Information:</strong> If you sign in with Google or another provider</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Game Progress Data</h3>
    <p>We store your in-game progress and achievements, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Areas of the map you've explored ("fog holes")</li>
        <li>Cleared geographical zones (S2 sphere data)</li>
        <li>Points of Interest (POIs) you've discovered and released</li>
        <li>Game statistics and progress metrics</li>
        <li>Timestamps of when areas were explored</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Purchase tokens and transaction IDs</li>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Payment information (credit card details) is processed by Google Play Billing and is never stored on our servers.</p>

    <h3>1.6 Analytics Data</h3>
